# MongoDB-Distributed-Bank-Queue-Number-System
I developed this mongoDB distributed database model when i was in the second semester of the 4th grade at school in 2019.
I developed this mongoDB database project to learn features about the NoSQL (mongoDB commands, json data type, documents, schemas, nodes etc.).

About Project:

A distributed mongoDB database application for classifies customers who buy tickets to connect to the call center according to density.
To reduce the density in the system, customers are distributed to different regions.
Each node represents a different region in the system.
Classification is made according to the location information of the customers.
If there are too many customers in a region (e.g. region_A), customers are directed to the nearest region (e.g. region_B) to that region (e.g. region_A).
The purpose of this project is to serve customers faster and to balance the density in call centers.

     Language: NoSQL
